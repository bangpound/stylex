Stylex 
------

Creating prototypes or style guides with Silex and Twig.

See [this blog post](http://www.darrenmothersele.com/blog/2015/03/20/stylex-prototype-style-guide-tool/) for more details.

I've created a [Barbones](https://github.com/darrenmothersele/stylex-barebones) project that
demonstrates how to get started.

## Features

Create a style-guide or prototype front end code using Twig templates. Use YAML format to define sample data and content.

 * Create an atomic design (component-based design) using the power of Twig
 * Separate sample content out from your front-end markup
 * Reuse templates later in your process
 * Fully test front-end code before handing over to dev
