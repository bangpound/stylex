Stylex 
------

Creating prototypes or style guides with Silex and Twig.

See [this blog post](http://www.darrenmothersele.com/blog/2015/03/20/stylex-prototype-style-guide-tool/) for more details.

I've created a [Barbones](https://github.com/darrenmothersele/stylex-barebones) project that
demonstrates how to get started.
